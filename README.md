# **Project Description**
#### Our project is used to set stepper motor rotation angle using 4 switches:
#### 1-Half Step Switch
#### 2-Full Step Switch
#### 3-Get From Keypad Switch
#### 4-Stop Switch
## ***1-Half Step Switch***
#### When the half step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 45(45,90,135,...360) it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.
## ***2-Full Step Switch***
#### When the full step switch is pressed, the stepper motor will rotate by angles which are multiplies of 90(90,180.270,...360)it repeates several times until stop switch is pressed.
## ***3-Get From Keypad Switch***
#### When Get From Keypad Switch is pressed the angle is taken from the keypad. After writing the number in the keypad the * button must be pressed which represents the enter button and then the motor will rotate one time with this angle.
## ***4-Stop Switch***
#### It is used to stop stepper motor rotation but if it pressed when the motor rotates in the middle of full rotation or half rotation the motor is rotates first to 360Â° and then stop.
